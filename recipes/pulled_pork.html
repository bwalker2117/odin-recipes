        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat grill or smoker according to directions to 225℉.</li>
            <li>Trim the pork shoulder. Removing portions of the fat cap, so that it is only approximately 1/4 of an
                inch
                thick. Then score the fat, cutting a grid pattern into the fat cap, cutting just enough to get through
                the
                fat to the meat.</li>
            <li>Slather the entire pork shoulder with mustard, as a binder.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl combine the ingredients for the rub: salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. Stir
                together.</li>
            <li>Evenly sprinkle the rub over the entire pork shoulder. Press the rub into the mustard before turning the
                pork over to sprinkle the other side.</li>
            <li>Place the pork in the center of the smoker or the grill on the grate. Insert probe to monitor the
                temperature.</li>
            <li>In a spray bottle combine the apple cider vinegar and water. Shake to combine.</li>
            <li>Smoke for 2 hours before opening smoker. At this point open and spritz the pork, continue spritzing the
                pork
                every hour until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 160℉. This helps with the creation of the
                smoke
                ring and keeps humidity in the smoker.</li>
            <li>Once the pork reaches an internal temperature of 160℉ wrap using foil or peach paper. Place back in
                smoker
                to continue cooking.</li>
            <li>Cook until pork reaches an internal temperature of 195-205℉. Depending on the texture of pork you prefer
                will determine when you will want to pull off. At 195 pork is more moist but less tender, more string.
                At
                205 pork is more tender, more chunky than stringy, but less moist. Any temperature in this range will
                yield
                great pulled pork!</li>
            <li>Once internal temperature is reached, pull from the smoker, make sure the pork is wrapped nice and
                tight.
                Let rest for 1-2 hours before shredding. Store in a clean empty cooler, or in a turned off oven.</li>
