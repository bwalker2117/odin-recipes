        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>If using a bread machine, see next section below.</li>
            <li>Bring the milk to a near boil. Remove it from heat when you see it begin to steam and small bubbles form
                on the side of the pan. Let it reduce to lukewarm, between 80-90 degrees.</li>
            <li>Mix the milk, yeast, and honey in a small bowl until well combined. Let it sit for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix 3 tablespoons of the butter, the milk mixture, the room temperature egg, and 2 cups
                of flour. Mix slowly until smooth. (Use a mixer with a dough hook if you have one, otherwise it works by
                hand.) Gradually add the remaining 2 cups of flour and mix until a dough has formed.</li>
            <li>Add salt, and mix/knead for 8 minutes. Then drop the dough onto a floured surface and knead for a few
                more minutes.</li>
            <li>Spray a large bowl with cooking spray and drop the dough inside. Cover the bowl (plastic wrap or a damp
                cloth works) and let it rise for an hour in a warm place.</li>
            <li>Punch down the dough and roll it out on a flat, floured surface until it’s about ½ inch thick. Fold it
                in half and gently seal.</li>
            <li>Cut into 24 squares of even size and place on 2 lightly greased cookie sheets. Cover them and let them
                rise for 30-40 minutes,, until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the top is a light golden brown.</li>
            <li>Melt the remaining tablespoon of butter and brush the top of the rolls.</li>
            <li>Serve with Copycat Texas Roadhouse Butter.</li>
        </ol>
